# Best-Sell-Startergy
This is the testing project developed in COBOL mainframe , with the test plan and test cases executed with pass and fail results .
The code was tested with valid and invlaid scenarios having the smoke test in it.
There are number of files which which were developed for testing the invalid and valid test cases and giving the outputs which helped to note in the test cases. 
It was combination of Tesla and Best Buy which was a self-driving car .
They wanted to increase their sales performance by developing the new data entry system which also provide them profit of employee calculation at end of each year. 
The project was based of the COBOL mainframe with the VMware software .
At the beginning we, where told that we are gone follow the STLC which initiate with the test plan , test cases , environment set-up , test execution and test closure.
So we, started with the test plan were we wrote about the company why they were merging , factors are affecting them, which technology we are going to use, what are types of testing expected , exit criteria , ,who is in the team , which task will be handle of the team.
Then we where suppose to write test cases for new data entry system.
The test cases where design according to the BVA(Boundary value analysis) AND EQP(Equivalence partition) for all the fields .
The third was the environment setup which include the installation of VMware software and running the on the COBOL mainframe.
So after installation we performed smoke test, that represents if we send anything do the server of the COBOL is giving us any message back .
In our case the name must be written and after than we started writing the test cases in COBOL frame with the names and digits accordingly and run and executed the test , then we noted each and every test results and wrote everything the excel sheet. 
The system testing was done on it which checks the internal and also the external peripherals in order to get results and getting results for each input to desired output . 
The version 2 of the code was given and it was testing part 2 , where all the test cases were run again . 
It was noted back to Excel and finally the severity levels were marked for the FAIL test cases. This project taught us how to follow the STLC cycle , execute the test cases with EQP and BVA , COBOL and VMware and maintain the documents.
